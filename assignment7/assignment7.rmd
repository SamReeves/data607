```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this assignment, we will compare the data frame objects created by different file formats.  At this point, I can't really tell if I love or hate JSON data (it's got to be one or the other).  I suppose we will find out.

```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(XML)
library(jsonlite)

html_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWerefriend/data607/master/assignment7/books.html"
xml_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWerefriend/data607/master/assignment7/books.xml"
json_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWerefriend/data607/master/assignment7/books.json"

html_raw <- ""
xml_raw <- ""
json_raw <- ""

df_html <- ""
df_xml <- ""
df_json <- ""

```
